Voting power is (10 * 1.5) * 1.125 = 168.75


Code sample:
actor {
  let n : Nat = 50;
  let t : Text = "Hello";

  public func convert_to_text(m : Nat) : async Text {
    Nat.toText(m);
  };
 
}
The Nat module has not been imported.


Code sample:
actor {
  var languages : [var Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

  public func show_languages(language : Text) : async [var Text] {
    return (languages);
  };
 
}
The array definition should be [var "English", "German"...etc].
We can't return [var Text] because that would be exposing mutable data.


Code sample:
actor {
  var languages : [Text] = ["English", "German", "Chinese", "Japanese", "French"];

  public func add_language(new_language: Text) : async [Text] {
    languages := Array.append<Text>(languages, [new_language]);
    return (languages);
  };
 
}
The Array module has not been imported.
